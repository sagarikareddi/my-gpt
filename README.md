# My-GPT Overview:
In this project, I developed a comprehensive full stack application reminiscent of ChatGPT, integrating various technologies and features to provide a modern, responsive, and secure chat experience. Leveraging the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack.

Key Features:
User Authentication and Authorization:Developed a robust authentication and authorization system to manage user access securely.

Express-Validators Middleware:Implemented express-validators middleware for data validation, ensuring the integrity and validity of user inputs.

MongoDB for Chat Storage:Utilized MongoDB to store user chats, enabling efficient data retrieval and management.

Custom Authentication System with JWT Tokens:Developed a custom authentication system using JWT tokens for user authorization, with HTTP only cookies for enhanced security.

Protected User Routes:Implemented verification checks to protect user routes, ensuring authorized access to designated areas of the application.

Modern React App with Vite:Created a modern React application using Vite for efficient development and bundling.

Beautiful Chat UI with Material UI:Designed an aesthetic chat user interface using the Material UI library for a visually engaging experience.

Complete Responsive Design:Ensured full responsiveness across various devices, providing a seamless user experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Integrating OpenAI for AI-Powered Responses:Integrated OpenAI with Node.js and Express to incorporate AI-powered responses within the chat environment, enhancing interaction capabilities.

By combining these features, the project delivered a comprehensive ChatGPT-like clone "MY-GPT" that not only provides a rich chat experience but also demonstrates proficiency in modern web development practices and technologies.
